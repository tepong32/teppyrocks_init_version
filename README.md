theHideOut! website

First-ever Django project. Been working on this for like almost a year (only during my free time) because I'm a newb.
Intended to be a socmed/forum website. (Not really sure as of writing.) I am continuously making changes on the front-end designs and adding models and functionalities...whenever I can.

Disclaimer:

I only studied python and django and I only have a general  gist of idea about html and css. Javascript is a total mystery for me.
Apologies for the html files as they are completely messed-up...they're working, tho. ;)


This readme file will be official once the I feel like it can function as intended. As of writing, an older-versioned prototype is running on
thehideout.pythonanywhere.com. (It's really overwhelming to learn the django framework, git and how to operate pythonanywhere.)
My mind's about to blow-up but I'm just glad that this project is getting better with everyday I'm making changes to it.

Thanks.
